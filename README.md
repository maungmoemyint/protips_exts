# Pro Tips

This is the source code for the Dynamic Web Applications course project.

The application is a tips forum, called `Pro Tips`, that allows developers to register and share short bits of advice with each other, and then comment on the tips others have created.  The application basics have been completed, such as the core routes, views, controller actions and models.  The application has been styled using [the Bootstrap CSS library](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/getting-started/introduction/), and the files for this library have been included as `.scss` and `.js` files in the appropriate places within the `app/assets/` folder.

When you've completed the project, update this README to include the full public Heroku URL that your deployed application can be accessed at.  Enter the URL in the "Deployed URL" section below.  The URL will have the format https://random-subdomain-11223.herokuapp.com.

## Moe's Note

AWS S3 is successfully deployed to store the Avatar on the AWS storage.

All tasks have accomplished except one to create the comment using Javaform via AJAX. I am confused to create the java form.

Need help to submit to the git link provided by the extension school.
